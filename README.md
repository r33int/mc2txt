# mcserver2txt

This is a simple mod I made when I was bored. This mod prints the current server you are connected on to a text file, so you can use it in OBS for example, to show your current server to the world.
This mod is compatible with MC 1.8.9 for now. Other versions to come

## Usage
Download the mod from releases, then drop it into your mods folder, and profit!
The server you are connected on is printed to the "myserver.txt" file, placed at the root of your game directory (.minecraft).
